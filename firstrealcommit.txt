You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. He's alright. Leave her alone, you bastard. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Let's put him in there. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? What? Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. What? It's my dad. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. What, what, ma? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Doc. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.
